                <h3>HTML / CSS / AOS Library</h3>
                <p>
                    This is one one of my favourite projects so far. I enjoyed the 
                    process of learning how to use the AOS library for the animations. 
                    Whats next now is learning how to actually write the code for those animations

                <h3>HTML / CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    This is one one of the first projects we did with html / css and 
                    I enjoyed it very much. I've really taken a liking to this 
                    neumorphic style of design. It really gives a premium feel to the 
                    design. Take a look at it by clicking the buttons below.

                <h3>HTML / CSS / Owl Owl Carousel</h3>
                <p>
                    The owl carousel is another fun library that i definitely do recommend to anyone 
                    looking to make a carousel in their project. I had 0 hasles with any of its 
                    features.
